## Project 1

### Modeling & Fabricating Found Objects

| <sub>**Skill-building Objectives**</sub> |
| :---------------- |
| <sub> 1. Measuring and Dimensioning Objects </sub>   |
| <sub> 2. Representing 3D Objects using 2D Sketches</sub>   |
| <sub> 3. Modeling 3D Objects from 2D Sketches</sub>    |
| <sub> 4. Fabricating Modeled Objects on 3D Printers</sub> |


Look around. Objects are everywhere. In the built-environment nearly everything we see, touch or experience is someone's design project! 🤯🤯🤯

In this assignment we will explore the process of modeling and fabricating objects by making a replica of something we find. In our study, we will learn a common "design for fabrication" process, by: 1) measuring; 2) sketching; 3) modeling; and then 4) fabricating.

Start by finding 3 (or more) simple found objects that are around 6in<sup>3</sup>, or smaller. We should start from something simple and relativaly "printable". What is printable you ask? We will discuss this in class; and please refer to the resources page to see what things are important to consider. Bring your found objects to class, and we discuss their qualities and merits for this exercise. **You will select 1 object for this project.**

Once you've selected an object to model, you will start measuring and recording its measurements using [calipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers). This is the "dimensioning" process.

After you have the basic dimensions recorded, you will sketch your object's profiles and outlines in 2-dimensions, using either Illustrator or Fusion 360. You'll need to considering how the 3D object can be represented with just flat lines and profiles. Beginning with simple line-sketches is a very common way to model 3D objects in the industry. This will take some practice and we will look at common ways to approach and think about this in class. 

When we can represent an object's main features as 2D sketches and outlines, we will transfer your 2D drawings into 3D dimensions and models by way of extruding, cutting and otherwise shaping. We will utilize the 3D tools in Fusion 360. There are a number of features we explore to create a final shape. 

Finally, we will attempt to fabricate our objects using 3D printers. Beforehand we will visit the UT Fab Lab, and learn about the capabilities of the school's 3D printers. We will also explore various strategies and methods for getting your objects to come out successfully, and learn about what makes an object "printable". Visit the [resources page](https://github.com/mmansion/UT_FMX_213/blob/master/RESOURCES.md) to get details on Fab Lab hours, location and more.

```IMPORTANT``` - Be sure to document your process throughout this assignment. Our end goal is to have a classroom critique, where we compare our 3D fabricated models to the original found objects, and then discuss: 1) what worked; 2) didn't work; and 3) what can be done differently in the future for better results.

#### Final Deliverables

## Project 2

### Storytelling with Objects

* [Workshop Presentation 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NUij-Kjhn2nqt1CMeZFRjGepr0obiT5Bx9rFV0cvGgY/edit#slide=id.g6eca19f4c2_0_3)

* [Project No.2 - Assignment](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UMNn3O4FMefnhH9vQxoUobvb0EtTQZQuVI1CCdrHrcM/edit?usp=sharing)

* Choose only 1 of the following options

#### Option 1

Select a favorite film. Select an object from that film. Develop a completely new narrative for this object—something unique and different from the original story. Model the object in Fusion 360; then create 3 photorealistic renders of the object inside a new scene(s) (backgrounds). Describe the scene(s) in a written paragraph. 


#### Option 2

Select a favorite film. Create an object that was not part of the original film. Taking 3 frames from the original footage, place your object into each scene. Develop a new narrative that explains the object’s relevance in the scene.

#### Option 3

Select a favorite film. Select an object from that film. Develop a completely new narrative for this object—something unique and different from the original story. Model and fabricate a scale model of the object, using the printers and tools in the fab lab.  Build a miniature set, or find a location where you can photograph the physical object, in a real-life scene. Describe the scene in a written paragraph.

## Project 3

### Nature-Driven Design

| <sub>**Skill-building Objectives**</sub> |
| :---------------- |
| <sub> 1. Explore the Sculpt (and Patch) Workspaces</sub>   |
| <sub> 2. Use a Canvas to sketch from a reference image</sub>   |
| <sub> 3. Use freeform (T-Splines) and surface modeling techniques to create a more organic 3D forms</sub> |

Until now we've mainly focused on creating solid models in the Fusion 360 Modeling Workspace. We discovered how to take 2D sketches and extruded 3D forms—a common workflow for any 3D environment. But the parametric features in Fusion 360 (expressed in the timeline) are unique, and allow us to go back to our sketches, change dimensions, and then update the shape of our model at any time. The Modeling workspace in Fusion 360 is best for designing precision objects intended for fabrication. 

Two other common modeling methods in Fusion 360 are Freeform and Surface modeling, part of the Sculpting and Surface workspaces respectively. In the Sculpt workspace we work with T-Splines, which are essentially freeform surfaces that can be subdivided, and allow for adjustment of any segments, edges or vertices; in the Patch workspace, we work with flat surfaces and can extrude single lines.

#### Assignment

1. Find a flora-based lifeform in your home or in some nearby nature Try to choose something that inspires you, or that has a unique form.
2. Take photos of the plant from various angles. Study it closely. What are its qualities? 
3. Write out a list of notes describing the shape, form, texture and color of the plant.
3. Consider these notes and sketch several ideas on paper for a vase design; the design should consider the qualities and somehow express or respond to these qualities.
4. Use the canvas feature in Fusion 360 to create a reference. You don't have to follow it exactly, but it should "inform" your model's design.
5. Try using a combination of Freeform and Surface modeling tools to create a unique artifact. Mold your design into a model that can be 3D-printed. (IT IS LIKELY THAT WE CANNOT ACTUALLY PRINT THESE OBJECTS. BUT YOU SHOULD MODEL IT AS IF YOU WERE GOING TO PRODUCE IT. THIS MEANS THAT SEAMS OF SURFACES SHOULD BE STITCHED AND THE OBJECT 'WATER TIGHT')

`NOTE` - In this [Process Example](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LJ_UXP3m26EptotrXA-EqCMNsqEb5TCafy5FZxsnsPc) I've worked through this assignment. It might be helpful to see one interpretation of this work. Since this is a art assignment, your interpretation is going to be different, but should follow a similar process.

* Use Fusion 360 to build a cut-away view (see examples below) and populate your scene by designing a layout/floorplan, before adding walls and objects. You can either model the objects from scratch, or assemble them from found 3D assets online (be sure to cite any stock assets). At least some of the objects should be modeled by you. 

* Use materials and textures to create the look of your scene. Use the decal features in render view to create realistic looking image-based textures on objects. You can use a photorealistic background, or make something more stylized. Output a rendered view of your scene that sets the mood atmospherically with good lighting.

**Deliverables**
<br>
* At least one final 3D Render of your scene with textures and lighting effects
* At least one (up to 3) detail shots (zoomed in views) of some features of the space

#### Project 4 (Option 4) 

**Product Design**
<br><br>

* Can you think of a 3D-design that can solve a problem in your life? Imagine. If you could solve just one problem in your life, then you might be able to solve that same problem for others. The idea of “scratching your own itch” is a valid method of creating a product idea. See some of the images below for examples.

* Start by making observations of your day-to-day life. What kinds of frictions or pain-points do you have? Is there something you do regularly that could be improved with a 3D-printed design? Use Fusion 360 to develop a 3D prototype to solve one problem you are having.

**Deliverables**
<br><br>

* A blog post that summarizes your product design concept (min 300 words). Be sure to include a clear description of the problem your product aims to solve, and how your design addresses that problem.
* Create 3 final 3D renders of your designed object. Include views from several different angles. Be sure to call out any important features that the audience should understand.
* Final 3D model placed in the shared Fusion 360 Class Folder
