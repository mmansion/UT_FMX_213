| <sub> 1. Measuring and Dimensioning Objects </sub>   |

Look around. Objects are everywhere. In the built-environment nearly everything we see, touch or experience is someone's design project! 🤯🤯🤯

In this assignment we will explore the process of modeling and fabricating objects by making a replica of something we find. In our study, we will learn a common "design for fabrication" process, by: 1) measuring; 2) sketching; 3) modeling; and then 4) fabricating.

Start by finding 3 (or more) simple found objects that are around 6in<sup>3</sup>, or smaller. We should start from something simple and relativaly "printable". What is printable you ask? We will discuss this in class; and please refer to the resources page to see what things are important to consider. Bring your found objects to class, and we discuss their qualities and merits for this exercise. **You will select 1 object for this project.**

Once you've selected an object to model, you will start measuring and recording its measurements using [calipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers). This is the "dimensioning" process.

After you have the basic dimensions recorded, you will sketch your object's profiles and outlines in 2-dimensions, using either Illustrator or Fusion 360. You'll need to considering how the 3D object can be represented with just flat lines and profiles. Beginning with simple line-sketches is a very common way to model 3D objects in the industry. This will take some practice and we will look at common ways to approach and think about this in class. 

When we can represent an object's main features as 2D sketches and outlines, we will transfer your 2D drawings into 3D dimensions and models by way of extruding, cutting and otherwise shaping. We will utilize the 3D tools in Fusion 360. There are a number of features we explore to create a final shape. 

Finally, we will attempt to fabricate our objects using 3D printers. Beforehand we will visit the UT Fab Lab, and learn about the capabilities of the school's 3D printers. We will also explore various strategies and methods for getting your objects to come out successfully, and learn about what makes an object "printable". Visit the [resources page](https://github.com/mmansion/UT_FMX_213/blob/master/RESOURCES.md) to get details on Fab Lab hours, location and more.

```IMPORTANT``` - Be sure to document your process throughout this assignment. Our end goal is to have a classroom critique, where we compare our 3D fabricated models to the original found objects, and then discuss: 1) what worked; 2) didn't work; and 3) what can be done differently in the future for better results.

#### Final Deliverables

**`Materials Due by class on Thursday, 2/20)`**

Bring your found objects and the 3D-printed replica to class. We will discuss these as a group in a round-table critique.

The following materials should be submitted to *mmansion@ut.edu* :

**1. A zip folder containing the following:**
  * Photo of your found object
  * Image of the modeled object
  * Photo of the printed object
  * STL file of the model (exported from Fusion 360)

**2. A link you your blog post for project 1, with the following:**

  * The above-mentioned images of your object (original / modeled / fabricated)
  * Brief paragraph describing
    * what is the object is
    * how closely could you came to resembling the original
    * what you think worked and  didn't work
    * what would you do differently next time?
    * any other details you find relevant

## Project 2

### Storytelling with Objects

* [Workshop Presentation 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NUij-Kjhn2nqt1CMeZFRjGepr0obiT5Bx9rFV0cvGgY/edit#slide=id.g6eca19f4c2_0_3)

* [Project No.2 - Assignment](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UMNn3O4FMefnhH9vQxoUobvb0EtTQZQuVI1CCdrHrcM/edit?usp=sharing)

* Choose only 1 of the following options

#### Option 1

Select a favorite film. Select an object from that film. Develop a completely new narrative for this object—something unique and different from the original story. Model the object in Fusion 360; then create 3 photorealistic renders of the object inside a new scene(s) (backgrounds). Describe the scene(s) in a written paragraph. 


#### Option 2

Select a favorite film. Create an object that was not part of the original film. Taking 3 frames from the original footage, place your object into each scene. Develop a new narrative that explains the object’s relevance in the scene.

#### Option 3

Select a favorite film. Select an object from that film. Develop a completely new narrative for this object—something unique and different from the original story. Model and fabricate a scale model of the object, using the printers and tools in the fab lab.  Build a miniature set, or find a location where you can photograph the physical object, in a real-life scene. Describe the scene in a written paragraph.

#### Submitting your work

Please place your Fusion 360 Model into the "[FMX-213] Shared Class Folder". Be sure to place it into the folder with your name. Name your file **Project2_TitleOfWork**
 

The following materials should be submitted to *mmansion@ut.edu* :

**1. Images:**
  * The final composited images
  * Screenshot of the modeled in Fusion 360

**2. A link you your blog post for project 1, with the following:**

  * The above-mentioned images
  * Brief paragraph describing
    * What is the object is and why you chose it.
    * The scene(s) and their narrative backstory.
    * What you think worked and  didn't work
    * What would you do differently next time?
    * Any other details you find relevant

## Project 3

### Modeling from Nature

| <sub>**Skill-building Objectives**</sub> |
| :---------------- |
| <sub> 1. Explore the Sculpt (and Patch) Workspaces</sub>   |
| <sub> 2. Use a Canvas to sketch from a reference image</sub>   |
| <sub> 3. Use surface modeling techniques (T-Splines) to create a more organic 3D forms</sub> |

Up until now we've primarily focused on creating solid models (bodies) in Fusion 360, using the "Modeling Workspace". We have also explored the process of starting from 2D sketches, and then extruding those models into 3D forms. 

Another common method of modeling is generally known as surface modeling. Fusion 360 allows us to use the sculpt environment (T-Splines) to create more organic shape and curvature modeling that can be quickly converting to BREP geometry. Rather than thinking of our 3D objects as discrete volumes containing a mass, we can imagine that the model as an empty shell, defined by only its surfaces (BREP). If surfaces are "stiched"  together, they effectively behave like any other solid body in Fusion 360. Once a body, you can use any of the shaping techniques, such as combine, cut, fillet, chamfer, etc. 

Surface modeling is sometimes more technical if unstiching and stiching curved surfaces together. Regardless, surface modeling is generally considered better for making more complex or organic forms, because you can create some really unique shapes that aren't based on simple primitive geometry. In this project we will explore surface modeling by attempting to model an object from nature. Our aim will be to create a digital still life image.

In [Exercise 3](https://github.com/mmansion/UT_FMX_213/blob/master/EXERCISES.md#exercise-3), we will practice using the Sculpt Tools in Fusion 360.
