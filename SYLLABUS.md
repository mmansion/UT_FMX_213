## Course Overview

🐒 Humans are the only species on earth (so far) with an ability reshape the world using their imaginations. We can dream, design and build tangible things that dramatically impact the planet and all of those living on it. Some of the things we make are really good, while others, um, not so much. One thing is for certain though! Today we find ourselves blessed with a host of realy powerful design and fabrication tools, just at our fingertips. The real question is: how will you, as an artist or designer, leverage these tools to make something incredible? 🤔

In this studio/performance-oriented class, we will focus on designing and modeling 3D objects for fabrication. We will explore workflows that allow you to take sketches, photographs and scans into a 3D environment, and then edit those designs order to manufacture them using 3D printers, and related fabrication hardware. We will also explore methods of texturing, lighting and rendering design concepts in order to create photo-realistic (or even abstract/artistic) representations of designs for purposes of documentation, visual communication, or even as part of other creative workflows. 🎨🎨🎨

## Aims & Objectives

By the end of this course you should be familiar with how artists and designers are leveraging modern design/fabrication tools in their practice, and be able to apply basic 3D modling, rendering and fabrication techniques in your own work.

👀 **This course we will explore:** 
* How to Model Objects in 3D
* Fabrication of Objects using 3D Printers
* Texturing, Lighting & Rendering

**We will utilize these softwares**

* Fusion 360 for modeling objects for fabrication
* Meshmixer - for experimenting with organic design
* Cinema4D (or Maya) - for modeling objects for animation
* Adobe CC - supporting tools in our process
* Unity - introduction (for visualizing 3D designs interactively)

A lecture or demonstration will typically begin each class period, of which students are
encourage to take notes. Demos may be reviewed later in the class or briefly at the
beginning of the next class. Although the projects are diverse in design and content,
they are designed to progressively build skills and ideas. All projects are designed to
establish the concept of the computer as a creative tool that allows universal integration
of media. Students will complete 3 projects. Some classes will be designated as lab
days, giving students time to work on their projects. Students will be required to attend
lab days.

## Participation & Assessment

Your assessment is based on  participation and performance. Since we will be exploring new technical and artistic territory,  you will be assessed on your progress, efforts and general application of the basic concepts introduced in class. In this course we use the format of critique as a tool for soliciting feedback and evaluation of projects. Group critique can feel a bit uncomfortable at first, but is invaluable in the real-world, and is found in most any art/design-related courses of study. Note that your work will *NOT* be graded if it is not presented at critique. See the section below on critique to better understand the criteria being evaluated.

### Attendance
This is a performance-based class, and interaction with peers and the professor cannot
be duplicated outside of class. Regular class participation and continuous faculty
evaluation are crucial elements of the learning process. One cannot participate, or
receive feedback on one's work, if one is absent. Attendance is mandatory. If you are
absent, it is your responsibility to acquire any material that you have missed, not the
professor's responsibility. Coming to class late (after roll call), leaving early, failing to be
prepared for class, or failing to fully participate in class, will count as an absence.

| Attendance  | |
| :---   | -------------   |
| <sub>1-3 Absences</sub> | <sub>0 points subtracted from final course grade</sub> |
| <sub>4 Absences</sub>  | <sub>10 points subtracted from final course grade</sub> |
| <sub>5 Absenses</sub>  | <sub>20 points subtracted from final course grade</sub> |
| <sub>6 Absenses</sub>  | <sub>30 points subtracted from final course grade</sub> |
| <sub>7 Absenses+</sub> | <sub>Automatic Failure. No Exceptions</sub> |

* #### Excused Absences

Students should contact instructors as soon as possible in these cases. Instructors may require documentation or verification to excuse unscheduled absences. Employment schedules, athletic conditioning and practice schedules and personal appointments are not valid reasons for excused absences. It is the responsibility of the student to initiate and maintain communication with the professor in case of an unusual circumstance. It is your responsibility to determine what you missed and coordinate with your classmates to make up the work.

  * Excused absences include:

    * Court-imposed legal obligations (e.g., jury duty and subpoenas)
    * Medical procedure
    * Required participation in University-sponsored events
    * (e.g. performances, athletic events, academic research presentations)
    * Observation of religious holy days
    * Requirements of military service
    * Unforeseen emergencies such as illness, injury, hospitalization, deaths in the immediate family, consequences of severe weather and other crises.

### Critique


Throughout the course students will receive feedback during critiques. Critique discussions should
come from the group, and aim to be both helpful and honest. Occasionally outside critics will be invited
to our critiques. Please treat our guest with respect and with enthusiasm for offering their time. Below is
a rubric to help elucidate what critique in this course actually means.

| Critique Criteria  | |
| :---   | -------------   |
| <sub> Is the work complete? </sub> | <sub> 20% </sub>|
| <sub> Does it conform to the assignment? </sub> | <sub> 20% </sub> |
| <sub> Is the student engaged in the discussion (for their work and for others)</sub>  | <sub> 10% </sub> |
| <sub> Is the work suitably presented (i.e. projected, printed, hung, good lighting, etc)? </sub> | <sub> 10% </sub>|
| <sub> Can the student speak to their design choices; do the choices seem considered? </sub> | <sub> 10% </sub> |
| <sub> How well does it address the intended concept or goal? </sub> | <sub> 10% </sub> |
| <sub> Does it function, or is it working as intended (literally or conceptually)? </sub> | <sub> 10% </sub> |
| <sub> Has the work been documented? </sub> | <sub> 10% </sub> |

### Grading
